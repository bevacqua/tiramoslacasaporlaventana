          h2 After over three years together, we're getting married!
          p The wedding party is on april 16th, at day time &mdash; from 12:30 pm and until 09:00 pm. There's going to be a cocktail, followed by dancing, barbecue, more dancing, drinks, desserts, cotillon, and more.
          p If you have kids, babies, or people you've otherwise created, you can keep calm and bring them. We have planned plenty of activities so that they have fun as well!
          p There's lots of room to park your car or helicopter, so don't worry about that!

          p
            em We recommend 20 hours of fasting, a couple of dance lessons, and an urge to have a good time!
